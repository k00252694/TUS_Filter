# TUS_Filter

TUS Filter description:
The filter has two big goofy eyes and two mouths one normally and the other mouth is placed on the forehead.
A pointy chin and a pointy head. I added that because its funny and different not like the rest of the filters on snapchat.

The poster for advertising the TUS filter the colour scheme is plain but I find when looking at posters its not really about how the poster looks with colour
its the words used in the poster that catch my eye and the font style and size.

There is an audio effect added into the filter but unfortunately it doesn't seem to work. Its a dark deep voice something spooky.
